## Banners 3.0.0 Image Storage and Location

When creating or editing a banner, the image URL is the location of your image. Banners does not provide for uploading or managing these files. Other file management modules such as *Files* or even *mGallery2* can be used as long as you are able to access a valid source for an <img> link. This source can be local or remote.

##### Examples of valid image URL values

*Ultimately, you may store your banner images anywhere you like. The imageURL will be used as a src in an img tag.*
