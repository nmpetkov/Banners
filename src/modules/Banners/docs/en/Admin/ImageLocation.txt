## Category Usage

In the Banners module, Categories are used to store Banner types (this is a change from version 2.1). Banner types are therefore created, edited, deleted and activated through the Categories module. On installation, Banners creates a standard list of [IAB Ad Units][iab] that can be used, but the admin is free to create additional banner types if desired.

### Create

Creating a new banner type is accessible from either the edit link in the new/edit banner or from within the Categories module. Categories should contain the following attributes: *height, width, time* (**height**: image height, **width**: image width, **time** is used in the rotating and fading blocks for a display duration and is in seconds).

### Edit

Editing a banner type is accessible from either the edit link in the new/edit banner or from within the Categories module.

### Delete

Deleting a banner type is accessible from either the edit link in the new/edit banner or from within the Categories module.

### Active Status

Categories can be declared active or inactive within the new/edit category interface. Inactive categories will not be available to any module.

## Image Storage and Location

When creating or editing a banner, the image URL is the location of your image. Banners does not provide for uploading or managing these files. Other file management modules such as *Files* or even *mGallery2* can be used as long as you are able to access a valid source for an <img> link. This source can be local or remote.

##### Examples of valid image URL values

~~~

*Ultimately, you may store your banner images anywhere you like. The imageURL will be used as a src in an img tag.*

## Banner Management

From the Admin Overview, banners can be created, edited, deleted and viewed.

### Create

Click on the *New Banner* link in the Banners Admin Menu. Choose a client from the list. The *Impressions Purchased* will restrict the number of impressions for the banner. When this amount is reached, the banner will automatically become inactive. The Banner *type* defines the size of your banner. The *Image URL* is the path to your image. The *Click URL* is the link to which you want a user to visit when clicking the image. *Hover text* will be displayed as the image title on mouseover.

### Edit

Click on the *Edit Banner* icon (red pen) in the Admin Overview to edit a banner. Banners with 'Unlimited' impressions can be converted to 'limited' by clicking the 'X' in the *Remaining* column. 'Limited' banners can be converted to 'Unlimited' or add additional impressions in the edit banner interface.

### Delete

Click on the *Delete Banner* icon (trash can) in the Admin Overview to delete a banner.

### View

Click on the *view image* icon from the Admin Overview to view the image.

## Client Management

From the Admin Overview, clients can be created, edited and deleted. At least one valid client must be created and available before a banner can be created.

### Create

Click on the *New Client* link in the Banners Admin Menu. The *Client Business Name* and *Client Real Name* Fields are internal to Banners and for Admin reference only. Each Banners client must be associated with one Zikula username. At this time, associating more than one client with the same Zikula username could produce unexpected results and is not supported. The *Extra Information* field will be displayed on mouseover of the client name in the Admin Overview.

### Edit

Click on the *Edit Client* icon (red pen) in the Admin Overview to edit a client.

### Delete

Click on the *Delete Client* icon (trash can) in the Admin Overview to delete a client.

## Client View

The Banners *Client* (or *user*) view will vary depending on whether the currently logged in user has been associated with a Banners Client or not. Users that have not be associated will see a page explaining that they are not a Banners Client. Actual clients will see an overview of all Banners (active and inactive) and their associated statistics along with the option to take some actions.

### Statistics

The statistics available here are the same as those in the Admin Overview.

### Editing Click URL

The Client can edit the *click URL* (destination link) for any banner. This does not change (or reset) the statistics or impression tracking. Clients can edit this at will.

### Emailing Statistics

The Client can email the statistics overview to their User email account on a per banner basis.

## Blocks {#Blocks}

Banners provides three different blocks for displaying banners on your site. In addition, Banners provides a template plugin and Content type which can also display Banners.

### Random Banner Display

This displays a random single image to the user on each page view. The image is static and will not change during the page view but will (potentially) change upon a reload.

##### Configuration Options

*   The Admin must define a **Banner Type**.
*   The Admin may *optionally* choose to show the banners **hovertext** as a javascript 'tooltip'. If not, the standard 'title' attribute is used.

### Protofade Banner Display

The Protofade block takes advantage of the [Protofade][] library to display multiple images with a gradient fade between them.

##### Configuration Options

*   The Admin must define a **Banner Type**.
*   The Admin may *optionally* choose to show the banners **hovertext** as a javascript 'tooltip'. If not, the standard 'title' attribute is used.
*   The **Transition duration** is the speed at which the banners fade from one to the next. Value is seconds.
*   The Admin may *optionally* display slideshow controls (next, prev, play, stop).
*   The Admin may *optionally* autostart the slideshow (recommended).
*   The Admin may *optionally* use an eSquare transition (default is simple fade)
    *   If using the eSquare transition, you must set number of **rows**, **columns** and **background color**.
*   Actual banner *display time* is defined in 'time' attribute for the Banner Type in the Categories module.

### Rotating Banner Display

The Rotating block uses the [Translucent Slideshow script from Dynamic Drive][dynamicdrive] to display multiple images with a 'wipe' transition between them.

##### Configuration Options

*   The Admin must define a **Banner Type**.
*   The Admin must define a **Transition speed**. This is the speed at which the banners transition from one to the next. This value is NOT in seconds. In fact, a greater number is faster (recommended value is 50).
*   Actual banner *display time* is defined in 'time' attribute for the Banner Type in the Categories module.

## Template Plugin

The template plugin is available *globally*. This means you can use it in any theme or module template. The plugin mimics the behavior of the standard **Random Banner Display** block. It requires one parameter: the blocktype ID (the category ID)

example usage:
~~~
{bannerdisplay blocktype=10012}
~~~

## Content Support

The Content module is supported with one contenttype 'plugin'. This also mimics the standard **Random Banner Display** block. You are required to choose an Banner Type.

## Permission Settings

Banners supports *category-based* permissions and *item-based* permissions.

In order to deny access to unregistered users to a particular banner, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | Banners:: | <banner id>:: | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | Banners:: | 52:: | No access`

In order to deny access to unregistered users to all events in a certain category, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | <Category ID>:: | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | 93:: | No access`

In order to allow a subgroup to administrate Banners, you can use a permission setting like so:

`BannerAdmins | Banners:: | .* | Admin access`

Be sure to define the group and assign members as appropriate.

*Remember that the **order** in which your permission settings occur (bottom to top) is **crucial**! *

## Menu Configuration

Link to Banners by entering `{Banners}` in a menu block.

Go to your Block administration and edit/create the Menu block to hold your link to Banners.

The Menu Block editing screen should look *something* like this:

Name    | URL       | Title
--------|-----------|------
Banners | {Banners} | My Banners
