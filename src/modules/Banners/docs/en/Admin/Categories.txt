## Banners 3.0.0 Category Usage

In the Banners module, Categories are used to store Banner types (this is a change from version 2.1). Banner types are therefore created, edited, deleted and activated through the Categories module. On installation, Banners creates a standard list of [IAB Ad Units][iab] that can be used, but the admin is free to create additional banner types if desired.

### Create

Creating a new banner type is accessible from either the edit link in the new/edit banner or from within the Categories module. Categories should contain the following attributes: *height, width, time* (**height**: image height, **width**: image width, **time** is used in the rotating and fading blocks for a display duration and is in seconds).

### Edit

Editing a banner type is accessible from either the edit link in the new/edit banner or from within the Categories module.

### Delete

Deleting a banner type is accessible from either the edit link in the new/edit banner or from within the Categories module.

### Active Status

Categories can be declared active or inactive within the new/edit category interface. Inactive categories will not be available to any module.
