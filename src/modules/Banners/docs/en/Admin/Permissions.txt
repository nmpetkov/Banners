## Banners 3.0.0 Permission Settings

Banners supports *category-based* permissions and *item-based* permissions.

In order to deny access to unregistered users to a particular banner, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | Banners:: | <banner id>:: | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | Banners:: | 52:: | No access`

In order to deny access to unregistered users to all events in a certain category, you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | <Category ID>:: | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | 93:: | No access`

In order to allow a subgroup to administrate Banners, you can use a permission setting like so:

`BannerAdmins | Banners:: | .* | Admin access`

Be sure to define the group and assign members as appropriate.

*Remember that the **order** in which your permission settings occur (bottom to top) is **crucial**! *
